You will need a connected device or an emulator running for the app to launch

1. Open the RNMapsSampleApp folder in VS Code located in the react_native folder
2. Open a terminal in VS Code and run 'npm install' to gather the necessary dependencies for the app
3. Open the project in Android Studio and run a gradle sync
4. Once the dependencies are install, run 'npx react-native start' which will launch the React Native server
5. When the server is done launching, it will prompt you with a list of command to run, since we want to launch the android app, press 'a'
The app will launch on your device and there should also be logs being shown in the terminal from the app installation
